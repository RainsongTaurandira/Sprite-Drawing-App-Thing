# Sprite-Drawing App Thing
 Very basic drawing app that exports to PNG; done in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

for Tool Jam 2, on itch.io

The theme is: This tool has some serious limitations.

This is a simple drawing app. Mouse-down in the square thing in the middle of the page, to draw. 

You can change colours and stroke width.

At the moment, it can download to PNG, with a transparent background. (The screen background colour isn't exported.) And the clear button clears the canvas.

It sort of accidentally fits the theme because I haven't gotten the eraser to work yet.

Leaning heavily on a couple tutorials:
Muslim Helalee's Udemy course
dcode's Youtube video on converting canvases to PNG
and an assortment of youtube videos and the usual HTML5 documentation at W3Schools and DMN Web Docs
